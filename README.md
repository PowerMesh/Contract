# Blockchain Integration

## Overview
Blockchain integration enables the Distributed GPU Sharing Platform to use blockchain technology for user authentication, payment processing, and rewards distribution. The system should support smart contracts and be able to interact with various blockchain networks.

## Components:

### 1. Blockchain Interface Module

#### Purpose:
To communicate with the blockchain network and facilitate transactions and data storage on the blockchain.

#### Functionalities:

- **Network Connection**: Establish and maintain connection with the blockchain network.
- **Data Reading/Writing**: Read from and write data to the blockchain network.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interact with smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.

#### Technology considerations:
- The module should be adaptable to support different blockchain networks.
- Security should be maintained during communication with the blockchain.

### 2. Wallet Management Module

#### Purpose:
To handle blockchain wallet addresses that are used for authentication and transactions.

#### Functionalities:

- **Wallet Registration**: Register a userâ€™s blockchain wallet address for authentication.
- **Wallet Balance**: Check the token balance of the registered wallet.
- **Transaction History**: Retrieve transaction history associated with the wallet.

### 3. Payment Processing Module

#### Purpose:
To handle transactions such as payments made by Resource Consumer Clients and rewards distributed to Resource Provider Clients.

#### Functionalities:

- **Payment Submission**: Submit payments for tasks processed on the platform.
- **Rewards Distribution**: Distribute tokens as rewards to resource providers based on their contribution.
- **Transaction Verification**: Verify transactions on the blockchain network.

#### Technology considerations:
- Transactions should be handled in a secure and efficient manner.
- Implement logic to calculate rewards based on the usage/contribution of GPU resources.

### 4. Smart Contracts

#### Purpose:
To automate processes such as payments and rewards distribution on the blockchain network.

#### Functionalities:

- **Token Management**: Manage the token economics, including minting, burning, and transfers.
- **Reward Distribution Logic**: Implement logic for distributing rewards to resource providers.
- **Payment Logic**: Implement logic for handling payments from resource consumers.

#### Technology considerations:
- Smart contracts should be audited for security vulnerabilities.
- The contracts should be flexible and upgradable.

## Scalability and Security

- The system should be designed to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.
- Security measures should be in place to ensure secure transactions and protect sensitive data.
